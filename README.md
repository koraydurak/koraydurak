## Dear friends 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page!

I’m a **physician** with a passion for **clinical research**. Due to curiosity about data, technology, and innovation, I got pulled into **statistics and R coding**.

I slowly share **R scripts and more** that grow out of my clinical and research work, I hope parts of it can  be **useful, reusable, or spark ideas** for others working in similar areas.

> 💡 **Note**  
> I do not have any professional background in coding, so I am a very slow learner 😄  
> If you know any interesting packages, functions, formatting tricks, or any experience, I’d genuinely love to learn from you.
